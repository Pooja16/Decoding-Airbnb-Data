# Smart tricks that will help us $ave for our next Airbnb Trip


## Introduction:
The goal was to deduce the most important factors that dictate the price of airbnb stay. I also went after the various categories within each of the factors to see the difference and the most obvious choice for the stay while balancing comfort and price.

This python file has all the code that was used to put through the entire analysis. It also walks through the standard CRISP-DM process.

This includes the dataset that was used for the analysis.

## Summary of results of analysis:
	
The goal of my analysis was to reduce the time it takes to find the least expensive listings with our requirements in mind. This was done by finding the most important factors that correlate to the listing price and then looking at various cuts to see how these factors relate to price.

For a traveller who can adjust and share an apartment this will be the first point resulting in decreasing prices. For private apartment the price goes higher.

The next most important metric that determines the price is the number of baths. Sharing would again be the winner followed by any additional number of baths.

The next metric is the distance from the city center. If we have a vehicle and do not mind driving extra minutes to the city, staying away would definitely be a big win.

The next is the accommodation capacity. The price is least for single occupancy. 

Then comes the number of bedrooms. We can save by sharing bedroom with travel mates or family rather than going for additional rooms.
